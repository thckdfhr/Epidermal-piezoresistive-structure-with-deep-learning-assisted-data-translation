## Abstract

> Continued research on the epidermal electronic sensor aims to develop sophisticated platforms that reproduce key multimodal responses in human skin, with the ability to sense various external stimuli, such as pressure, shear, torsion, and touch. The development of such applications utilizes algorithmic interpretations to analyze the complex stimulus shape, magnitude, and various moduli of the epidermis, requiring multiple complex equations for the attached sensor. In this experiment, we integrate silicon piezoresistors with a customized deep learning data process to facilitate in the precise evaluation and assessment of various stimuli without the need for such complexities. With the ability to surpass conventional vanilla deep regression models, the customized regression and classification model is capable of predicting the magnitude of the external force, epidermal hardness and object shape with an average mean absolute percentage error and accuracy of < 15 and 96.9 %, respectively. The technical ability of the deep learning-aided sensor and the consequent accurate data process provide important foundations for the future sensory electronic system.

> a. Illustration of the sensor deformation as the attached elastomer bends due to external stimuli. b. The relationship between the three parameters (i.e., stimulus magnitude, substrate hardness, and sensor output), where separate colors are used for the hardness of the distinct substrates. c. The overall structure of our model shows a stacked hierarchy with initial and final dense layers, and five block operations (details shown in Figure 3c). Input for block operation: ‘Input 1’ from the feature maps of the previous layer, and ‘Input 2’ from the feature maps of all the preceding layers, except ‘Input 1’. d. Conventional implementation of block operation, where each group consists of divided input 1 and whole input 2 for the group dense operation. e. Customized implementation of block operation, where input 1 and input 2 are placed in group dense and general dense operation, respectively. Same size outputs from each operation are added for the final output. f Epoch-loss graph of the training and validation sets for the prediction of substrate hardness from the given sensor output and mechanical stimulus. g. Epoch-loss graph of the training and validation sets for the prediction of sensor output from the given hardness and mechanical stimulus. h.
